    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        First of all, I want to thank my dear seniors for taking this great initiative.</p>
    <p> Actually from my 3rd semester, I was finding <img src="images.jpeg" alt="Bouring" width="500" height="30"
            title="Khuje Pacci nah!"> in doing C <sub><b>Programming</b></sub>.
        As a Result, I lost my track in doing CP.
        Then from few days, I was thinking to move on Web Development site and I was in searching a course on web
        development.
        Finally I found it and already done the 1st class of this course.<br><br>
        About the 1st class experience, It was <sup><b>Quite Easy</b></sup> for me to catch the basic things HTML.
        Because I knew most of
        them from my college life. The new thing I learned is about <mark>The Visual Studio HTML Hacks and its some
            important
            Extentions.</mark>
        I also learned about some several HTML tags that are self-closing and do not require a closing tag. These are:
        <br>
    <blockquote><b>
            < img> - used to insert an image into a web page.<br>
                < br> - used to insert a line break.<br>
                    < input> - used to create a form input field.<br>
                        < link> - used to link an external CSS or JavaScript file.<br>
                            < meta> - used to provide metadata about a web page.<br>
                                < hr> - used to insert a horizontal line.<br>
        </b></blockquote>


    Anyway, Inshallah! My journey through the web development will be blessed with <b>Colo
